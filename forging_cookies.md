<h1>Forgining cookies </h1>
<h2>Flask</h2>
<p>Web applications made in Flask have their own session hanlding mechanism. They typically use sessions module to handle sessions and cookies.</p>
<p>The cookies are JWT. JWT stands for JSON Web Tokens. They have a header, a body and a signature.</p>
<p>If you get hold of a cookie, you can either bruteforce the signature or look for LFI attacks to leak the secret_key. Bruteforcing the key can take ages, if its not intentionally made weak.</p>
<p>So, the alternative is to leak the source code. The key is generally in the main.py or app.py file in the root directory. The file should contain the application being initialized with a Secret key, as <code>app.config["SECRET_KEY"]</code>=&lt;secret_key_here&gt;.</p>
<p>You can use the "secret key" to modify the cookie. </p>
<h4>How to modify the cookie?</h4>
<p>You can either make an application using Flask and make a form a cookie of your choice, or you can use <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/flask">flask-unsign</a>.</p>

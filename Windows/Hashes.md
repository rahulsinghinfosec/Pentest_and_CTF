<h1>Windows Hashes</h1>
<p>LM and NT are ways in which windows stores your passwords. They can be used to crack the passwords.</p>
<p>NTLMv1/v2 are challenge response protocols used for authentication in Windows environments. 
  These use the NT-hash in the algorithm, which means it can be used to recover the password through Brute Force/Dictionary attacks. These are generally used by domain cotrollers, Active Directory, and services/protocols like Kerberos,etc.</p>
<h2>LM Hashes</h2>
<h3>LM</h3>
<p>LM-hashes is the oldest password storage used by Windows Due to the limited charset allowed, they are fairly easy to crack. 
  You can obtain them, if still available, from the SAM database on a Windows system, or the NTDS database on the Domain Controller.</p>
<p>LM was turned off by default starting in Windows Vista/Server 2008, but might still linger in a network if there older systems are still used.</p>
<p>When dumping the SAM/NTDS database, they are shown together with the NTHash, before the colon.<br>Example: Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:b4f79698831d92b61f886438e36c0c52:::</p>
<p>The format is uid:rid:lmhash:nthash </p>
<p><b> If you DO get “aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee”, that means it’s not being stored as an LM hash, because that hash turns out to be blank or null.</b>So, in this case the this can be avoided and our focus should be on the nthash</p>
<h2>NT Hashes</h2>
<h3>NTHash (A.K.A. NTLM)</h3>
<p>This is the way passwords are stored on modern Windows systems, and can be obtained by dumping the SAM database, or using Mimikatz. 
  They are also stored on domain controllers in the NTDS file.</p>
<p>This is also referred to as NTML Hash, but Microsoft refers it to as, NTHash. <br><b>Algorithm: MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))</b></p>
<h3>NTLMv1 (Net-NTLMv1)</h3>
<p>The NTLM protocol uses the NTHash in a challenge/response between a server and a client. 
  The v1 of the protocol uses both the NT and LM hash, depending on configuration and what is available. This version is depreciated but can still be used in older versions.</p>
<p>Responder is a great tool to capture the hashes, which can then be used to crack using tools like. </p>
<h3>NTLMv2 (Net-NTMLv2)</h3>
<p>This is an imporved version of NTMLv1. This uses a different algorithm which makes it a bit harder to crack as compared to NTMLv1. Hashes can be captured using Responder.</p>
